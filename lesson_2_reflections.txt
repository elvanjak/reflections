What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

.git was created. Without this step it is not an git repository but normal directory/folder.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Staging are gives list of files where changes should be committed and also the list of untracked files. Working directory has last checkouted files, but repository included all others info necessary for git service.
